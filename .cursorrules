# Project Context

Project: E-commerce Serverless (AWS Lambda, Python, Terraform)
Architecture: Clean Architecture / Modular Monolith style

# Code Style & Rules

- Language: Python 3.11
- Use Type Hints in all function signatures.
- NEVER use relative imports (e.g., `from .repository import X`). ALWAYS use absolute imports (e.g., `from repository import X`).
- Pydantic models must always be in `schemas.py`.
- Business logic must always be in `service.py`.
- Database queries must always be in `repository.py`.
- Do not remove existing comments or existing methods unless explicitly asked.

# Documentation & Comments

- PROFESSIONALISM: Write comments suitable for a public GitHub repository.
- NO ARTIFACTS: STRICTLY FORBIDDEN to leave "edit markers", conversational notes, or "breadcrumbs" (e.g., avoid: `# I changed this line`, `# Fixed bug here`, ``).
- WHY, NOT WHAT: Comments should explain the _reasoning_ (business logic/complexity) behind the code, not describe what the code is doing (e.g., avoid: `x = x + 1 # Increases x`).
- DOCSTRINGS: Use Google Style Python Docstrings for public modules, classes, and functions.

# AWS & Terraform

- When writing Terraform, check for existing variables in `variables.tf` before creating new ones.
- Use `aws_lambda_powertools` for logging and tracing.

# Testing

- Use `pytest` and `unittest.mock`.
- Never try to connect to real databases in unit tests.
